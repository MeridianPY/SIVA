# SIVA

SIVA, or the Strategic Integration Via Activities service, is an application that integrates your Destiny 2 experience with Discords rich presence features. When running, your Discord server-mates will be able to see what activity you are in and how many people there are in your fireteam for any activity.

SIVA is lightweight and fast, using a custom-built Bungie API manager to ensure speed and efficency.
